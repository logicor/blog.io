Hi, I am NanJ. As a Bachelor of physics at Xi'an Jiaotong University, I received a particularly well-rounded mathematics and computing education. My interest in computer science field began while I was in college. I tried to teach myself programming, and then won the first prize when I participated in the school mathematical modeling contest. Then I went to North China University of Technology for a master’s degree in Signal and Information Processing.After the master’s education, I worked for one year and later applied for the PhD study at Xian Jiaotong University. But I finally found out that I was still fascinated with the research of computer science, for which I quit the PhD study and turned to my research interest. My research interests are machine learning, data analysis and statistics.

# Education


## [Xi'an Jiao tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/)
- PhD of Physics
- Direction : Electron-impact Molecule Experiment
- Dropout for personal reason.
- (I have to say it was a hard choice. Professor Xu invited me to his team after I contacted him. But when I got in touch with foreign scholars  and investigated the status of foreign research. I decided to go abroad and wanted to break through myself in scientific research. Thanks to Professor Xu for his understanding.)

# Research Experience

## Identification Research based on DHV(Dorsal Hand Vein) (NSFC61271368)
- Assistant with professor Yiding Wang in Beijing
- Biometric image pattern recognition research, concentrating on processing image data to gain robust feature for identification.
- Developed a method for synthesizing virtual DHV example based on PCA to construct very large DHV databases.
- Built a DHV sample collection system with an infrared camera and a computer as well as collected a student DHV database.
- Individually wrote a DHV recognition program respectively using LBP and SIFT which had a good performance both in real and virtual DHV database.

## Third generation momentum spectrometer project 
- Research Assistant assisted with professor Zhongfeng Xu in Xi’an
- Installation of experimental instruments and systematic study of particle physics
