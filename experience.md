# Research Experience

## Identification Research based on DHV(Dorsal Hand Vein) (NSFC61271368)
- Assistant with professor Yiding Wang in Beijing
- Biometric image pattern recognition research, concentrating on processing image data to gain robust feature for identification.
- Developed a method for synthesizing virtual DHV example based on PCA to construct very large DHV databases.
- Built a DHV sample collection system with an infrared camera and a computer as well as collected a student DHV database.
- Individually wrote a DHV recognition program respectively using LBP and SIFT which had a good performance both in real and virtual DHV database.
