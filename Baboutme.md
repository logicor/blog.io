Hi, I am NanJ. As a Bachelor of physics at Xi'an Jiaotong University, I received a particularly well-rounded mathematics and computing education. My interest in computer science field began while I was in college. I tried to teach myself programming, and then won the first prize when I participated in the school mathematical modeling contest. Then I went to North China University of Technology for a masterâ€™s degree in Signal and Information Processing. I was first introduced to machine learning and solved an identification problem by using CNN. The fascination of machine learning makes me want to do some deeper research.


# Education


## [Xi'an Jiao tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/)
- PhD of Physics
- Direction : Electron-impact Molecule Experiment
- Dropout for personal reason.
- (I have to say it was a hard choice. Professor Xu invited me to his team after I contacted him. But when I got in touch with foreign scholars  and investigated the status of foreign research. I decided to go abroad and wanted to break through myself in scientific research. Thanks to Professor Xu for his understanding.)
